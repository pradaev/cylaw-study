# Search & Validate

<rule>
1. **Search**: Query official docs ("Next.js 15", "Cloudflare Workers 2026", "Clerk", "Stripe") before coding. Use online search to validate solutions against 2026 best practices.
2. **Sources**: Prioritize Official Docs > GitHub Issues (<12mo). Reject old tutorials (>18mo). Always include the current year (2026) in search queries for time-sensitive tech.
3. **Log**: Record architectural decisions in `DECISIONS.md` (Date | Topic | Decision | Rationale).
4. **Verify**: Don't guess APIs for beta/edge tech. Use the `web_search` tool to confirm current implementation patterns before proceeding.
