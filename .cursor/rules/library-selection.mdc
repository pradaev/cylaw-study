1. **Health**: High stars/downloads, recent release (<12mo). Veto archived projects.
2. **Compatibility**: Must support Next.js 15+ (React 19) and Cloudflare Workers (Edge runtime).
3. **Validation**: Check official docs or recent (<12mo) endorsements.
4. **Process**: Log choice in `DECISIONS.md` with source/rationale.
