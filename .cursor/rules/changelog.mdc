# Changelog Maintenance

<rule>
1. **When to Update**: Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md` when implementing user-facing changes:
   - New features
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Bug fixes visible to users
   - Performance improvements users would notice

2. **Format**: Add entries at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` (after the header):
   ```
   - [YYYY-MM-DD] Category: Brief description of the change
   ```
   Categories: `Feature`, `Improvement`, `Fix`, `UI`

3. **Skip**: Don't log internal refactors, code cleanup, dev tooling, or backend-only changes unless they affect user experience.

4. **Purpose**: Entries are used for user announcements, so write descriptions from the user's perspective.
