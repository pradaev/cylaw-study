# Changelog Maintenance

<rule>
1. **When to Update**: Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md` when implementing user-facing changes:
   - New features
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Bug fixes visible to users
   - Performance improvements users would notice

2. **Format**: Use existing CHANGELOG.md structure with dated sections and category headers:
   ```
   ## YYYY-MM-DD

   ### Added
   - Description of new feature

   ### Changed
   - Description of change

   ### Fixed
   - Description of bug fix
   ```

3. **Skip**: Don't log internal refactors, code cleanup, dev tooling, or backend-only changes unless they affect user experience.

4. **Purpose**: Entries are used for user announcements, so write descriptions from the user's perspective.
